# WebComicDownloader
A little Console Utility to download blog based webcomics

It's only in beta stage, since there are some little issues left.

##Known Issues
- When using the RegExp scraper, the encoding might get screwed.
- When using the XPath scraper, the inner xml of the selected elements will not get saved (thus losing the style).
- Display screwed when scapring more than one webcomic at once
